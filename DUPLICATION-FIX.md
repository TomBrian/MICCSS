# MICCSS Plugin Duplication Fix

## The Problem

You're seeing duplicate "MICCSS - Manual Inline Critical CSS" plugins in your WordPress admin because both `miccss.php` and `miccss-improved.php` have the same plugin header.

## Quick Fix (Choose One Option)

### Option 1: Keep Simple Version ✅ ALREADY DONE

- I've already disabled the plugin header in `miccss-improved.php`
- You can now activate `miccss.php` without seeing duplicates
- The `miccss-improved.php` file is now just a reference file

### Option 2: Use Enhanced Version (Recommended)

1. **Deactivate** the current plugin in WordPress admin
2. **Delete** `miccss.php`
3. **Rename** `miccss-improved.php` to `miccss.php`
4. **Restore the plugin header** by replacing the top comment block with:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: MICCSS - Manual Inline Critical CSS
 * Plugin URI: https://github.com/TomBrian/miccss
 * Description: A WordPress plugin for manually inlining Critical CSS to improve page load performance. Defers non-critical CSS using preload with fallback.

 */
```

5. **Activate** the plugin again

## Differences Between Versions

### Simple Version (`miccss.php`)

- Basic functionality
- Manual settings save
- Simple admin interface

### Enhanced Version (`miccss-improved.php`) - Recommended

- Singleton pattern (better performance)
- AJAX validation
- CSS caching system
- Minification option
- Better error handling
- Enhanced security
- Live CSS statistics
- Import/export functionality

## Current Status

✅ Plugin duplication fixed - no more duplicate entries in plugin list
✅ You can safely activate `miccss.php` now
⭐ Recommended: Switch to enhanced version for better features

---

**The duplication issue is now resolved!** You should see only one MICCSS plugin in your WordPress admin.
